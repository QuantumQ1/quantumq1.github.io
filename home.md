# Lab of Quantum Fields and Strings

Welcome to the **Lab of Quantum Fields and Strings**.  
Our group works on fundamental problems in **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**, **String Theory (ST)**, and **Scattering Amplitudes**.  
We aim to uncover hidden structures behind quantum interactions, develop new mathematical frameworks, and apply modern amplitude techniques across field theory, gravity, and string theory.

---

## Research Areas

Our current research interests include:

- **Modern Scattering Amplitudes**  
  On-shell methods, recursion relations, color–kinematics duality, dual conformal symmetry, geometric formulations.

- **String-Theory Amplitudes & \(\alpha'\)-Corrections**  
  Field-theory limits of string amplitudes, universal relations, recursion and differential-equation methods for stringy corrections.

- **Effective Field Theories**  
  Higher-derivative operators, EFT bootstrap, constraints from unitarity, locality and analyticity.

- **Quantum Gravity & Holography**  
  Amplitudes in AdS/CFT, bootstrap perspectives, and connections to black hole physics.
