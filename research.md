# Research

My research is broadly focused on **theoretical high-energy physics**, especially on the structure of **scattering amplitudes** and their realization in **string theory** and related effective field theories.

Below is a brief overview of my current research interests and some suggested introductory references for students and collaborators.

## 1. Scattering Amplitudes in Gauge Theory and Gravity

I am interested in the modern formulation of scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and gravity, including on-shell methods, recursion relations, and hidden structures such as dual conformal symmetry and color–kinematics duality.

Typical questions include:

- How do on-shell methods simplify perturbative calculations in gauge theory and gravity?
- What is the geometric meaning of amplitudes (e.g. Grassmannians, polytopes)?
- How do these structures generalize beyond supersymmetric theories?

## 2. String Theory Amplitudes and \(\alpha'\) Corrections

Another main direction is the study of **string scattering amplitudes** and their field-theory limits, including the structure of \(\alpha'\)-corrections to gauge and gravity theories. I am particularly interested in:

- How string amplitudes encode infinite towers of higher-derivative operators.
- Universal relations between bosonic string, heterotic string and superstring amplitudes.
- Field-theoretic methods (e.g. differential equations, recursion, bootstrap) applied directly to stringy amplitudes.

## 3. Effective Field Theories from String Theory

String theory naturally generates a large class of **effective field theories** for gauge fields, scalars and gravity. I am interested in:

- The space of EFTs that can arise as low-energy limits of string theory.
- Constraints from unitarity, locality and analyticity on higher-derivative operators.
- Relations between string-derived EFTs and modern amplitude bootstrap approaches.

**Recommended reading (introductory level)**

## 4. Holography and Quantum Gravity (in progress)

I am also interested in connections between scattering amplitudes, string theory and **holography**, in particular:

- How flat-space or AdS scattering data are encoded in CFT correlators.
- What amplitude-inspired tools can teach us about black holes and quantum gravity.

**Suggested starting points**

- J. Polchinski, *String Theory*, Vol. 2 – chapters on AdS/CFT.  
- O. Aharony, S. Gubser, J. Maldacena, H. Ooguri and Y. Oz, “Large N Field Theories, String Theory and Gravity,” [arXiv:hep-th/9905111](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9905111).
