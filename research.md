# Research

Our gourp's research is broadly focused on **High-Energy Physics Theory**, especially on the structures of **scattering amplitudes** in the **QFT** and **String Theory**.

## A brief historical review of scattering amplitude research and its major developments:

1. The spinor-helicity formalism, introduced creatively in the 1980s by three Chinese physicists, greatly simplified the structure of scattering amplitudes. This method became known as the “Chinese Magic.” A prominent example is the MHV tree-level amplitude in pure Yang–Mills theory obtained by Parke and Taylor:

   $$

   A_{n}\left[1^{+} \ldots i^{-} \ldots j^{-} \ldots n^{+}\right]=\frac{\langle i j\rangle^{4}}{\langle 12\rangle\langle 23\rangle \cdots\langle n 1\rangle}

   $$

   Around the same time, Witten recognized the underlying mathematical structure and introduced twistor methods into scattering amplitudes, formulating the twistor string model and significantly advancing our understanding of the physics behind amplitudes.

2. In the 1990s, the unitarity-cut method, pioneered by Bern, Dixon, and Kosower, emerged and successfully resolved many one-loop amplitude computations. This pushed the precision of theoretical predictions for observable quantities to the next-to-leading order.

3. Around 2005, on-shell methods experienced major breakthroughs. The Britto–Cachazo–Feng–Witten (BCFW) recursion extended external momenta into the complex plane and used Cauchy’s residue theorem to fully reveal the analytic structure of tree amplitudes, expressing them via recursion relations. This greatly simplified amplitude computations. Combined with the forward limit, BCFW can also be applied to loop integrands. BCFW additionally leads to the Cachazo–Svrcek–Witten (CSW) off-shell formalism, which decomposes amplitudes into recursive structures built from MHV amplitudes.

4. Around 2008, Bern, Carrasco, and Johansson (BCJ) proposed the BCJ relations—also known as color-kinematics duality—which further constrained the freedom of tree-level amplitudes and revealed deep connections between gauge theory and gravity amplitudes. As a mathematician, Hodges made significant contributions during this period: he wrote the MHV gravity tree amplitude in determinant form, introduced momentum twistors, and applied polytopes to describe amplitudes, resolving spurious poles in BCFW recursion. This inspired later work by Nima et al., including the use of Grassmannians to describe tree amplitudes in \mathcal{N}=4 SYM.

5. The year 2013 marked an important milestone: Cachazo, He, and Yuan (CHY) introduced the CHY formalism, expressing arbitrary-dimensional tree amplitudes in a remarkably elegant form based on integrals over the Riemann sphere. Meanwhile, Nima Arkani-Hamed and collaborators sought the mathematics behind scattering amplitudes and introduced the Amplituhedron—a geometric object whose volume encodes tree amplitudes and one-loop integrands in \mathcal{N}=4 SYM.

6. In 2017, Sebastián Mizera introduced algebraic topology into scattering amplitudes, interpreting certain amplitudes as intersection numbers in topology and computing the number of master integrals in loop computations. Nima and collaborators further elevated the amplituhedron to a broader mathematical framework: **positive geometry**, extending amplitude ideas to many other contexts (cosmological wavefunctions, scalar field theories, etc.).

7. ………

  In summary, current scattering amplitude research branches into several major directions. Some researchers focus on high-loop computations, which are extremely complex and often rely on bootstrap techniques and symmetry principles (color-kinematics duality, dual conformal symmetry, etc.) to compute integrands, integrals, or their symbols. Others focus on the mathematical structures behind amplitudes, such as Hopf algebras and coproducts. Still others pursue geometric interpretations of amplitudes, including positive geometry and related frameworks.




Below is a brief overview of Our gourp's research interests and some suggested introductory references for students and collaborators.

## 1. Scattering Amplitudes in Gauge Theory and Gravity

I am interested in the modern formulation of scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and gravity, including on-shell methods, recursion relations, and hidden structures such as dual conformal symmetry and color–kinematics duality.

Typical questions include:

- How do on-shell methods simplify perturbative calculations in gauge theory and gravity?
- What is the geometric meaning of amplitudes (e.g. Grassmannians, polytopes)?
- How do these structures generalize beyond supersymmetric theories?

## 2. String Amplitudes 

Another main direction is the study of **string amplitudes** and their field-theory limits, including the structure of \(\alpha'\)-corrections to gauge and gravity theories. I am particularly interested in:

- How string amplitudes encode infinite towers of higher-derivative operators.
- Universal relations between bosonic string, heterotic string and superstring amplitudes.
- Field-theoretic methods (e.g. differential equations, recursion, bootstrap) applied directly to stringy amplitudes.

## 3. Effective Field Theories from String Theory

String theory naturally generates a large class of **effective field theories** for gauge fields, scalars and gravity. I am interested in:

- The space of EFTs that can arise as low-energy limits of string theory.
- Constraints from unitarity, locality and analyticity on higher-derivative operators.
- Relations between string-derived EFTs and modern amplitude bootstrap approaches.

## 4. Holography and Quantum Gravity (in progress)

I am also interested in connections between scattering amplitudes, string theory and **holography**, in particular:

- How flat-space or AdS scattering data are encoded in CFT correlators.
- What amplitude-inspired tools can teach us about black holes and quantum gravity.
