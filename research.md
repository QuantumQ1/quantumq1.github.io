# Research

We study:

- **Scattering amplitudes**: analytic structure, transmutation operators, novel recursion.
- **String amplitudes**: α' expansions, relations to field-theory limits.
- **Quantum gravity**: AdS/CFT applications to black hole physics.

Short descriptions, representative papers, and links can go here.
